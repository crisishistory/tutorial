# Hi Terrence and Rose!

I've put together a mini-book of notes from our sessions where I get you up to speed on various tech topics.

```{tableofcontents}

This is also a nice, small GitHub repository where you can practice editing Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks privately with me if you'd like. 

Here, book content is structured with JupyterBook. You can see examples of the major file types, as well as some sample content. Check out [the Jupyter Book documentation](https://jupyterbook.org) for more information.
